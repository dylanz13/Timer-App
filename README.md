# Focus Keeper: A Study Timer App

**Boost your focus and productivity with the Pomodoro and Flowtime Techniques!**

Focus Keeper is a free, user-friendly application designed to help you tackle any task requiring sustained concentration. It implements two popular study techniques:

* **Pomodoro Technique:** Break down work into focused intervals (usually 25 minutes) separated by short breaks to maintain focus and avoid burnout.
* **Flowtime Technique:** Encourage longer periods of uninterrupted focus with customizable work and break intervals, ideal for deep work sessions.

## Who can benefit from Focus Keeper?

* Students: Ace exams and crush deadlines by maximizing your study sessions.
* Professionals: Enhance your productivity and concentration for work projects.
* Anyone: Get things done by staying focused on challenging tasks, whether it's writing, coding, or learning a new skill.

## My Inspiration

As a student, I've experienced the power of the Pomodoro and Flowtime techniques firsthand. Focus Keeper aims to make these methods readily available and convenient for everyone.

## Take Control of Your Focus

Focus Keeper empowers you to:

* **Manage Subjects:** Add tasks, projects, or topics you need to focus on, with optional descriptions.
* **Customize Timers:** Set timers for each subject using the Pomodoro Technique's 25-minute intervals or create custom work and break durations for Flowtime.
* **Visualize Progress:** A clear timer display keeps you motivated and on track.
* **Track History:** Review completed subjects and analyze your study patterns.
* **Save & Load Sessions:** Save your study plan and progress to resume later, or pick up where you left off with a single click.

## Getting Started with Focus Keeper

1. **Adding/Editing Subjects:**
   * Click the "Modify Subject" button to add a new subject or edit an existing one.
   * Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "History Essay") and an optional time allocation (format: 00:25:00 for 25 minutes).
2. **Start Your Focus Session:**
   * Enter a desired time next to "Enter a Time" and click "Start Timer" to begin your focused work session.
   * The timer will visually represent your progress.
3. **Save & Load Your Work:**
